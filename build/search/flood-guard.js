/**
 * ctx_search flood-guard — per-agent-context progressive throttle.
 *
 * Background (#79 / #155 / #697): ctx_search carries a progressive throttle
 * so a single actor cannot spam dozens of individual searches and flood the
 * context window instead of batching via ctx_batch_execute. The original
 * implementation kept ONE module-global counter on the MCP server process.
 *
 * Issue #769: a parallel multi-agent fan-out (Claude Code Task/Workflow)
 * runs N subagents concurrently against the SAME per-session MCP server
 * process. With a single global counter their independent calls are summed
 * into one budget, so legitimate fan-out ("10 agents x 2 calls") trips the
 * guard that was only ever meant to catch ONE actor spamming. The budget is
 * tool-availability state that is logically per-agent-context, so the counter
 * must be keyed per agent-context — NOT removed. Single-actor flood
 * protection is preserved exactly; only the bucketing changes.
 *
 * This module is pure and transport-free so the policy is unit-testable
 * without spinning up the MCP server. `src/server.ts` owns the singleton and
 * supplies the per-call agent key (the session/agent id from
 * currentAttribution()).
 */
/**
 * A rolling-window call counter bucketed per agent-context key. Each key gets
 * an independent window + counter, so concurrent subagents do not consume one
 * another's budget while a single greedy actor is still throttled and blocked
 * exactly as before.
