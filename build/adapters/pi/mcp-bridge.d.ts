/**
 * MCP-stdio bridge for the Pi Coding Agent extension.
 *
 * Pi 0.73.x has no native MCP support — its README is explicit:
 *   > "No MCP. Build CLI tools with READMEs (see Skills), or build an
 *   >  extension that adds MCP support."
 *
 * Without this bridge, the routing block tells the LLM to call
 * `ctx_execute`, `ctx_search`, etc. — but those tools never enter Pi's
 * tool list, so the LLM cannot reach them. context-mode then becomes a
 * pure cost on Pi (~2.5K tokens of system-prompt overhead with 0
 * actual ctx_* calls). Reported in mksglu/context-mode#426.
 *
 * The bridge spawns `server.bundle.mjs` as a long-lived child via stdio
 * JSON-RPC, performs the MCP handshake, calls `tools/list` once, and
 * registers each returned tool through `pi.registerTool({ … })`. Each
 * tool's `execute()` forwards into the child via `tools/call` — same
 * code path Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and the other adapters use, so
 * Pi behavior matches the rest of the platform suite.
 *
 * No external dependencies — pure node:child_process + JSON line frames.
