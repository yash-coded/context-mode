 * session_before_compact, session_compact, session_shutdown.

 * Issue #545 — Pi workspace resolver.
 *
 * Pi's runtime sets PI_CONFIG_DIR to ~/.pi (its CONFIG dir, not the user's
 * project). The extension previously used this as the project anchor, which
 * meant every Pi session re-rooted under ~/.pi — collapsing all of a user's
 * projects into a single phantom workspace. This helper picks the user's
 * actual project directory while NEVER returning a path equal to or under
 * ~/.pi/.
 *
 * Cascade:
 *   1. PI_WORKSPACE_DIR — set by Pi's bridge (extension-set, freshest)
 *   2. PI_PROJECT_DIR   — legacy/user override
 *   3. PWD              — shell-set, survives process.chdir
 *   4. cwd              — last resort
 *
 * Each candidate is rejected if it equals ~/.pi or lives under ~/.pi/. If
 * every candidate is poisoned, falls back to homedir() as a safe non-config
 * anchor — caller may still render a "no project context" notice but the
 * function stays total.
