 *   3. Fallback to Claude Code (low confidence — most common)
 *
 * Verified env vars per platform (from source code audit):
 *   - Claude Code:    CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT, CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT,
 *                     CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, CLAUDE_SESSION_ID | ~/.claude/
 *   - Gemini CLI:     GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR (hooks), GEMINI_CLI (MCP) | ~/.gemini/
 *   - KiloCode:       KILO, KILO_PID | ~/.config/kilo/
 *   - OpenCode:       OPENCODE_PROJECT_DIR, OPENCODE_CLIENT,
 *                     OPENCODE_TERMINAL, OPENCODE, OPENCODE_PID |
 *                     ~/.config/opencode/
 *   - OpenClaw:       OPENCLAW_HOME, OPENCLAW_CLI | ~/.openclaw/
 *   - Codex CLI:      CODEX_CI, CODEX_THREAD_ID | ~/.codex/
 *   - Cursor:         CURSOR_TRACE_ID (MCP), CURSOR_CLI (terminal) | ~/.cursor/
 *   - VS Code Copilot: VSCODE_PID, VSCODE_CWD | ~/.vscode/
